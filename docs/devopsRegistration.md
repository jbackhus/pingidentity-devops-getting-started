# Ping Identity DevOps registration

Registering for our DevOps program grants you credentials that are supplied to our containers through environment variables. This streamlines license issues by allowing the container to automatically retrieve an evaluation license upon container startup.

> Evaluation licenses are short-lived and *not* intended for use in production deployments.

To get your DevOps user and key:

1. [Create a Ping Identity account, or sign on to your existing account](https://www.pingidentity.com/en/account/sign-on.html).
2. Follow the steps to [Request your DevOps key](PROD-LICENSE.md#obtaining-a-ping-identity-devops-user-and-key).

    Your DevOps credentials (user name and key) will be sent to your email.

   > For ease of use, we recommend you use the DevOps user and key approach when trying our container and stack examples. However, if you'd rather use an existing Ping Identity product license, see [Use an existing license](existingLicense.md) for instructions before proceeding.

3. Complete setting up your DevOps environment in [Get started](getStarted.md).
